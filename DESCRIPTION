Description: Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of wavelet
    multiple regressions and correlations, and cross-regressions and
    cross-correlations from a multivariate time series.  Dynamic versions
    of the routines allow the wavelet local multiple (cross-)regressions
    and (cross-)correlations to evolve over time.
