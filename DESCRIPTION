Description: Wavelet routines that calculate single sets of wavelet multiple regressions and correlations, 
        and cross-regressions and cross-correlations from a multivariate time series.  
        Dynamic versions of the routines allow the wavelet local multiple (cross-)regressions and 
        (cross-)correlations to evolve over time.
